### The Idea üí°
**Pooliver** is an android application that allows Small Home Businesses, Local Shops and Localites to deliver thing with the concept of CarPooling.</br>
A user can create a Delivery on the app, and other users traveling on the same route can pick up and drop the items for that person, without having to go an extra mile, all while making easy money, which goes straight into your pockets, NO Commission Needed. 

### Features ‚ú®
- **Realtime Firebase Database** to see all the changes within the app in realtime.
- **Choose your own price** for the delivery and never look back to overpriced delivery solutions. 
- **Reduced Carbon Footprint**. Help save the future of the upcoming generations.
- **Get Easy Money** with your day to day local route.
- **Firebase Authentication** so that you never loose track of anyone, without authentic ID.

### Installation üíª
- Clone the Repository from the Git CLI using the command.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Phi-Coder/Pooliver.git && cd Pooliver
```
- Open the Project Folder in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or Visual Studio Code.
- Mail your SHA-256 and SHA1 key to yuvraj.dagur928@gmail.com or ujjwalmttl1@gmail.com with subject `Add SHA to Firebase Project | Pooliver`
- Run the App.

### Google Technologies Used üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Android
- Google Places API
- Google Maps SDK

### Future Scope üåç
We're planning to introduce this idea to the real market. The idea still need some more furnishing and we are working day and night to make this as close to perfect as we can.</br>
As of now, there is no payment gateway withing the app, so the users need to deal with cash only. This can be changed by introducing some in-app payment methods so that the verifiability of the app as well as the users can be increased. </br>
We're also planning to introduce a little bit of Gamification by awarding users with coupons so that more and more people can stick to the platform, which in turn helps the society as a whole.
